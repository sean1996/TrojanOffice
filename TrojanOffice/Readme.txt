1. To change update interval, go to serverConfig.
2. Start programServer.java and click start listening first.
3. To open client editor, choose TextEditorMain.java
4.  I finished and tested all the requirements. Sometimes if an exception is thrown, the server will stop running. So you kinda have to restart everything again.
